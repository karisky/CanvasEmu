## CanvasEmu Information
CanvasEmu is the branch of Canvas made for Emulators by fixing the package name of canvas, this project is handled by [Yunnie (yunkunjp)](https://github.com/yunkunjp). to get the official version of canvas for Android Phones Only, go to [__CanvasCord__](https://discord.com/invite/autowax) or goto [__Canvas GitHub Releases__](https://github.com/lukas0x1/SML-filehost/releases).

Canvas (Sky_ModLoader) is a tool made by [artDev (artdeell)](https://github.com/artdeell) & [Lukas (lukas0x1)](https://github.com/lukas0x1) for Sky: Children of The Light (Sky:CoTL) that allows users to add or create Libraries and Mods for the game. It uses the [__.so__](1) format for loading mods and the app itself only uses __~15 MB__ of your phones storage.


## How to Install
1. __Install an emulator__. You will need to install an emulator, my recomendation is either [__MuMu Player__](https://www.mumuglobal.com/index.html) or [__Bluestacks__](https://www.bluestacks.com/bluestacks-5.html) but you should choose to what is in your preference, if you think you want to use Bluestacks because it's more trusted then go ahead, if you think using MuMu Player is better because of the less restrictions of content and mods then use it. There are more emulators out there that you can choose from that (if supported) can run CanvasEmu.

- Just to note that Bluestacks blocks GameGuardian and will most likely block canvas if they feel like it, so for long term use MuMu Player X

2. __Setup the Emulator__. After you're done installing your Emulator of choice you will need to setup your emulator to work with sky, this is so you don't get the horrendous popup saying that you can't play sky because of incompatibility. For setting up the emulator so sky will work more proficiently, you will need to go to settings and tweak the graphics a little bit so canvas works properly. MuMu Players graphics settings will be in (Settings→Advanced), for BlueStacks it will be the first thing you see when you goto settings. 

You will need to set your graphics settings to around what is listed below:


#### Emulator Recomended Settings
------------------------------------

- Performance:                      Custom [ 5 → 16+ CPU Cores ] and [ 6G → 12G+ RAM ]

- [BlueStacks]                      Vulkan Rendering: ON
- [MuMu]                            Vulkan Graphics Rendering: ON

- [MuMu]                            Root Permission: ON
- [MuMu]                            Rendering Acceleration: ON

- [BlueStacks]                      Enable High FPS: ON [ 120 → 240 FPS ]
- [MuMu]                            High & Extra High FPS: ON

------------------------------------

3. __Install Sky__. After setting up your emulator you can install Sky:COTL. If you are using BlueStacks or any other emulator like it then you can use the Google Play Store, search up "Sky: Children of the Light", download it and you're done, But if you are using MuMu Player X or any Untrusted Emulators you will need to follow an extra procedure to be able to install Sky:COTL.

#### Install Sky:COTL on Untrusted Emulators
------------------------------------

1. Make sure you have the Aurora Store installed, Check the GitHub Repo to find the AuroraStore APK. if you need to update it, update it.

2. Make sure Root Permission is turned on, go into the Emulators Settings and turn on ROOT, this could either be "Root Access" or something else with the name "ROOT" or "Security".

3. Download and open Aurora Store and use an anonymous session if you don't want to login.

4. Hit the hamburger icon in the top left and go to "Spoof Manager", selecting "Google Pixel 3A" or any other supported phone should enable you to search for and download Sky:COTL in the Aurora Store.

------------------------------------

4. __Install CanvasEmu and Mods__. After installing Sky:COTL you can install CanvasEmu, if you haven't already downloaded the CanvasEmu file from the Releases Page do so. After installation you will need to open up the Mod Manager. you can install mods from [CanvasCord](https://discord.com/invite/autowax) or goto [The Libmod Library](https://github.com/thatskymod/Sky-CotL-Scripts/tree/gh-actions-test/Canvas/Libs), after you installed CanvasEmu correctly and have Selected your mods, you can enjoy being a Sky:COTL 'Hacker' (You'll become a real hacker when you make libraries for canvas).

## Issues
If canvas wont launch or it's crashing non-stop, there might have been some mistakes you have made along the installation process or other things that we can't really fix. If you need to report a bug, goto [CanvasCord](https://discord.com/invite/autowax) and submit a support ticket with the tag __CanvasEmu Bug Report__

*Q1: I can't login using my google account, neither my other account's! How do I fix this!*
Only way currently to fix this is to instead link a HUAWEI ID and login though that. This is because HUAWEI lets you login even if a browser is untrustworthy, and doesn't make an error message every time you try to login.

*Q2: I keep crashing every time I add a certain mod into the Mod Manager.*
This means the mod is incompatible with CanvasEmu, this happens because developers use certain techniques for initializing the mod that are not supported by emulators.

*Q3: It's asking me to update canvas, but it won't update!*
CanvasEmu will not auto-update, if you want consistent updates then just use canvas on your phone instead. other than that wait patently for another CanvasEmu update.
