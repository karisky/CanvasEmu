# CanvasEmu Update Notice

This is still outdated, but I will possibly make an update in the future for CanvasEmu. Even though the PC version is released there is no public cheats yet as of writing this message, when there is you wont really need this. To wrap this up all I have to say is that I might update CanvasEmu to the latest Canvas version and continue posting Emulator patches, other than that just use Canvas on your phone (you're only really going to use it for DukunCabul unless you don't).

Other than all of that chunk of text, why don't you take a look at the development of abomination for the PC version of Sky: Children of the Light! Telegram: https://t.me/abominationsky
